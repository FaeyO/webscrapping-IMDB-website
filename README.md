# Webscraping IMDb Top 250 Movies Using Wayback Machine

This repository contains the code and data for scraping the IMDb website's Top 250 movies using the Wayback Machine. The data collected includes movie title, year, duration, movie link, genre, and rating.

### Process Overview

1. **Scraping IMDb Website**: We used Scrapy to crawl through the IMDb website's archived pages on the Wayback Machine. The spider followed various links to extract data for each movie.

2. **Data Collection**: For each movie, we collected the following information:
   - Movie title
   - Year of release
   - Duration
   - Movie link
   - Genre
   - Rating

3. **Data Saving**: The scraped data were saved in a JSON file for further analysis and processing.

4. **Deployment**: The spider was deployed to the Scrapinghub cloud platform for efficient and scalable scraping.

### Repository Structure

- **`spiders/`**: Contains the Scrapy spider (`movies.py`) used for scraping the IMDb website.
- **`data/`**: Contains the JSON file (`movies_data.json`) where the scraped data is stored.
- **`requirements.txt`**: Lists all Python dependencies required to run the spider.
- **`scrapy.cfg`**: Configuration file for Scrapy settings.

### How to Use

1. Clone this repository to your local machine:

3. Run the Scrapy spider to start scraping:
